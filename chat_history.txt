User: what is this document about?
Assistant: This document is about an assignment for building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based Chatbot using Python and LangChain. The assignment has three key tasks: 

1. Data Loading: Load a dataset of choice and format it for easy querying.
2. Set Up RAG with LangChain: Use LangChain's tools to set up a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline.
3. Build the Chatbot: Build a Chatbot that can answer questions from users based on the loaded data.

The assignment aims to assess skills in RAG, Python, and LangChain for building a Chat application. The submission guidelines include uploading relevant files to GitHub, including comments in the code, and properly citing external sources. 

If you have any questions or need guidance, you can contact shubham@buildfastwithai.com or satvik@buildfastwithai.com.

User: can you generate me a sample code or give me an rough idea on how to do this?
Assistant: Here's a rough idea of how you can approach this assignment:

**Task 1: Data Loading**

* Choose a dataset (e.g., CSV, JSON, or any document format) that will serve as the knowledge base for your RAG Chatbot.
* Load the dataset into a Python data structure (e.g., Pandas DataFrame) for easy querying.
* Preprocess the data by tokenizing the text, removing stop words, and converting all text to lowercase.

Example code:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Preprocess data
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.corpus import stopwords

stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))

def preprocess_text(text):
    tokens = word_tokenize(text)
    tokens = [token.lower() for token in tokens if token.isalpha()]
    tokens = [token for token in tokens if token not in stop_words]
    return ' '.join(tokens)

df['text'] = df['text'].apply(preprocess_text)
```

**Task 2: Set Up RAG with LangChain**

* Install LangChain using pip: `pip install langchain`
* Import LangChain and create an instance of the `LLMChain` class.
* Define a function to retrieve relevant documents from the knowledge base based on a given query.
* Define a function to generate answers based on the retrieved documents.

Example code:
```python
import langchain

# Create an instance of LLMChain
llm_chain = langchain.LLMChain(llm=langchain.llms.HuggingFaceHub())

# Define a function to retrieve relevant documents
def retrieve_documents(query):
    # Use the preprocessed data to retrieve relevant documents
    relevant_docs = df[df['text'].str.contains(query)]
    return relevant_docs

# Define a function to generate answers
def generate_answer(query):
    # Retrieve relevant documents
    relevant_docs = retrieve_documents(query)
    
    # Generate answer based on the retrieved documents
    answer = llm_chain(query, relevant_docs)
    return answer
```

**Task 3: Build the Chatbot**

* Create a simple chatbot interface using a Python library like `tkinter` or `streamlit`.
* Define a function to handle user input and generate responses using the `generate_answer` function.
* Display the chatbot responses in the interface.

Example code:
```python
import streamlit as st

# Create a chatbot interface
st.title('RAG Chatbot')

# Define a function to handle user input
def handle_input():
    user_input = st.text_input('Enter your question:')
    if user_input:
        answer = generate_answer(user_input)
        st.write('Answer:', answer)

# Display the chatbot interface
handle_input()
```

**Bonus: Deploy on Streamlit**

* Create a Streamlit app using the `streamlit` library.
* Deploy the app on Streamlit Cloud or a local server.

Example code:
```python
import streamlit as st

# Create a Streamlit app
st.title('RAG Chatbot')

# Define a function to handle user input
def handle_input():
    user_input = st.text_input('Enter your question:')
    if user_input:
        answer = generate_answer(user_input)
        st.write('Answer:', answer)

# Display the Streamlit app
if __name__ == '__main__':
    handle_input()
```

Note that this is just a rough idea, and you will need to modify the code to fit your specific requirements. Additionally, you will need to ensure that your code is well-documented and follows Python coding standards.
